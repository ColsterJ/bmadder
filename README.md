Simple bookmarking WebExtension

*Derived from example "bookmark-it" and "commands" WebExtensions from MDN
*Basically, clicking the icon or pressing Ctrl+Space creates a bookmark in a folder named for today's date in Bookmarks Menu. Bookmark is only created if it isn't already present, and the folder named for today's date is only created if not already present similarly.
*Later updates could include:
**Auto-sorting items into separated groups based on content type
**Renaming bookmarks to be concise and remove i.e. "Gamasutra - Greg's blog - xxx" leading text
